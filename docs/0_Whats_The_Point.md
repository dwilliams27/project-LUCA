## What's the point of this

### Motivation
Modern AI has made available entirely new classes of "useful tools." These tools have truly novel capabilities, and I have yet to see them integrated into the core of many games. I believe there are fundamentally new sources of entertainment achievable through deeply integrating them into games. I think the game `InfiniteCraft` showed a glimpse of this novelty, though I don't think it leveraged a very advanced model at all. There is a TON of unexplored area here in my opinion, and I'm sure within a few years there will a game created that has a significant source of entertainment value that is novel and directly as a result of a modern generative AI model. I think it's still a very open question what types of interesting/fun experiences are possible now, but I feel like using these models to guide the generation of fundamental building blocks of a game would be fascinating if done right.

My attempt here is to try and integrate modern AI systems into a roguelike, agentic, evolution-themed autobattler. I honestly don't even know if this will be fun to play, but will hopefully be interesting! And will force me to learn a ton of new things if I haven't worked with before.
