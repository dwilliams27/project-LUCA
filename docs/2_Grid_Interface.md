# Grid Interface

The grid will contain a significant amount of information. This information needs to be displayed in an understandable way, be at least somewhat visually appealing, and fully capture all of the main elements of what's happening.

Grid will be an NxN matrix, with important UI elements on either side to fill up the window. The left and right panels will be essential to properly conveying what the hell is going on, maybe left side describes top processes owned by the player and right side is env/enemies?

## Particle System

Each individual resource will be displayed in a cell as a particle.
